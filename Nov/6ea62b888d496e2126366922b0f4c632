Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has said that the slogan “Ileri Oluwa”, which has become the mantra of his administration, was given to him by God.  Speaking yesterday at the thanksgiving service held in commemoration of the second anniversary of his administration held at The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Osun Province 1 Headquarters, Osogbo, Oyetola said the slogan came from a divine revelation where God assured him that he would be the Governor of Osun State.  He said: “The administration was founded by God Himself, and I will tell you why. I am ordinarily not one who sees visions, but on two occasions, I had a strange encounter. “Imagine the son of an Imam receiving a Christian song in a dream. That was my encounter.  All I could remember on both occasions was the last line of the song which says ‘Ileri Oluwa ni lati se’ (the will of God must be done). Outside of that dream, I had never heard the song before.  “When the impression was heavy on my heart, I called one of my friends to ask him about the song, and he told me the song was the Track 2 of Timi Oshikoya’s song. He went out to get me the album, and immediately I started listening to the track, my consciousness was restored and then I had an understanding of what God was saying to me.  “That revelation has continued to give me confidence of victory each time I’m faced with legal and political battles since becoming governor. On October 17, there was an attempt on my life, but the Almighty God spared my life because He has appointed me for a special assignment that must be accomplished.  “God has been faithful and He has shown us that all things are possible with Him. We promised to give priority to the welfare and security of citizens and God has helped us to pay full salaries since the inception of our administration. “We promised to look into the health of our people, and as we speak, we have delivered 332 primary healthcare centres across the state.  We have listened to the yearnings of the people and responded to their needs, especially in the area of education. “Today, I am here to thank Almighty God and I have every reason to do so. On 27th November, 2018, myself and deputy were sworn in as Governor and Deputy Governor to lead the affairs of the state.   “We are 24 months in government, though we have not had more than one year of uninterrupted service. We started with several months of litigation and then came the adverse effects of the global COVID- 19 pandemic, closely followed by the #EndSARS protests. There was also an assassination attempt on my life.  “But today, we are here to appreciate God who has made it possible for us to deliver on our promises. “We promised that we will pay full salary, we are doing so. In education, we have fulfilled our promise. We have prioritised the security of lives and property of our people. We have sustained the status of Osun as the most peaceful state in the country. “We are more secured than we used to be and our peace profile remains the best in Nigeria,” he said.  Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has blamed political thugs for the attack on his convoy at the venue of #EndSARS protest in Osogbo, on Saturday. He, however, vowed that the thugs will be fished out and brought to book.
