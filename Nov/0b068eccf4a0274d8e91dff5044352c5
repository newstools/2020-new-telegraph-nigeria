New Telegraph’s analysis of the 9M 2020 results of 11 DMBs, for instance, shows that their total Profit After Tax (PAT) increased to N662.8 billion from N622.5 billion in the corresponding period of  last year.  This means that the banks’ total PAT rose by N40.3 billion (6.5 per cent) in the period under review. The lenders are Access Bank, Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Guaranty Trust Bank (GTbank), FBN Holdings, Stanbic IBTC and Fidelity Bank.  The others are Union Bank, Sterling Bank, Wema Bank and Unity Bank.

It was followed by GTBank with a PAT of N142.3 billion in 9M 2020 compared with the N146.9 billion the lender reported in the same period of last year. Access Bank’s PAT increased by 15.68 per cent to N102.3 billion in the first nine months of the year from N88.4 billion in the same period of 2019.  UBA’s 9M 2020 results show that it reported PAT of N77.1 billion, as against the N81.6 billion the lender posted in the corresponding period of last year. FBN Holdings Plc’s PAT jumped by 31.71 per cent to N68.2 billion in the first nine months of the year from N51.7 billion in the corresponding period of last year.

Leading Tier 2 lender, Fidelity Bank, recorded a 7.0 per cent increase in PAT to N20.4 billion in the  first nine months of 2020 from N19 billion in the corresponding period of last year.
