 A Russian soldier is on the run after he hacked an officer to death with an axe then shot and killed two more soldiers at a base near the southern city of Voronezh, investigators say.
The military is searching for the fugitive – named as Private Anton Makarov – at the Baltimor airbase, the Investigative Committee (SK) says.
The soldier reportedly seized the officer’s pistol, which he used to kill the other two, in the attack on Monday, reports the BBC.
A fourth soldier was shot and wounded.
RIA Novosti news agency reports that hundreds of Omon and Sobr special forces soldiers are hunting for the fugitive. Voronezh is about 465km (290 miles) south of Moscow.
It is not clear why the soldier attacked the officer and opened fire.  *Military: 17 bandits, 1 officer, 2 soldiers killed The Nigerian military has suffered large casualties in Katsina State, after suspected armed bandits ambushed troops advancing towards a bandits' leader's camp at Shimfida in Jibia Local Government Area.   Highly placed establishment sources, who spoke in confidence with New Telegraph, said the… July 19, 2020 In "News" Police Counter-Terrorism operatives have rescued two soldiers who were earlier abducted by Boko Haram fighters in Borno State.   According to PRNigeria, the terrorists had killed some security personnel and abducted others after an attack on soldiers on a patrol.   This came after Nigerian troops had also repelled an… July 15, 2020 In "Metro & Crime" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday said he warned his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that there would be "an enormous price to pay" if Moscow is offering bounties to kill U.S. soldiers or other Western troops in Afghanistan.
