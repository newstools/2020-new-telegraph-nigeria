Reacting to the inflation figure, Prof. Uche Uwaleke said the latest figure wasn’t a shock. He attributed the rise to lingering effect of COVID- 19. He also cited increase in fuel pump price as a factor.  “With the effect of COVID- 19 on the economy still lingering, especially from supply chain disruptions, it is no surprise that headline inflation has continued to rise with the NBS October number coming in at 14.23 per cent up from 13.71per cent the previous month.  “Contributory factors include the continuous border closure, the increase in VAT and implementation of stamp duty as well as the high exchange rate, especially in the parallel market.  “The increase in the pump price of fuel also contributed because, according to the NBS, a major cause of core inflation came from increase in transport cost. It is of concern that food inflation is over 17 per cent and has remained the major driver of inflation even during this harvest season when expectations ordinarily should point to a downward trend,” he said.
