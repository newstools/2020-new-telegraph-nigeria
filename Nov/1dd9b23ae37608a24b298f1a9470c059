Okowa, who, however, added that the government would leave no stone unturned in improving the welfare and working conditions of the Bench and staff in the customary court system, reiterated that by virtue of Section 6 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) from which the Nigerian judiciary derived its powers to administer justice, District and Area Customary Courts are better suited to deliver justice at the grassroots without being bogged down by the technicalities of the common law.  The governor further disclosed that District and Area Customary Courts were well positioned to deal with matters involving land disputes, marriage, succession, inheritance, guardianship, and custody of children in rural communities, pointing out that their roles in the justice system were strategic.
