 Argentina legend Diego Maradona has been hospitalized in the city of La Plata, sources told ESPN Argentina.
The 1986 World Cup winner, who manages first-division side Gimnasia La Plata, is being treated for something that is not considered an urgent physical issue, sources said.
Maradona, who celebrated his 60th birthday on Friday, was in attendance of Gimnasia’s 3-0 win over against Patronato before leaving at kickoff.
