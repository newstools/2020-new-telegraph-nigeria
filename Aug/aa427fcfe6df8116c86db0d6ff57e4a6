 Former world heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson’s exhibition fight against Roy Jones Jr. has been moved to November.
The bout was originally set for next month.
But in a statement, promotional company Triller confirmed the fight would now take place on November 28 in Los Angeles, to coincide with the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
“Changing the date to November 28th will give more people the opportunity to see the biggest comeback in boxing history.
“This temporary inconvenience will last longer than Roy Jones Jr. He better be ready, I’m coming full force,” Tyson, 54, said in reaction.
Jones, the 51-year-old who won world titles in four weight classes, also welcomed the change of date.
“I’m ready and I stay ready, November 28th is gonna be epic,” Jones said.
Tyson retired from boxing in 2005 after a career that spanned two decades.
