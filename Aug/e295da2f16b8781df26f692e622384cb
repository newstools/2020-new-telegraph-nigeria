 The Duchess of Sussex has won a high court bid to keep secret the identities of five friends who gave an anonymous interview to a US magazine, in the latest stage of her legal action against Associated Newspapers.
Meghan is suing Associated Newspapers (ANL), the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online, over an article that reproduced parts of a “private and confidential” handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle, in August 2018, reports PA Media.
At a preliminary hearing in London last week, Meghan’s lawyers applied for the five friends who gave an interview to People magazine to remain anonymous in reports of the proceedings.
In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that, “for the time being at least”, the duchess should be granted an order that protects the identities of the five individuals.
