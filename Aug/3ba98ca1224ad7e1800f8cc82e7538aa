The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN), yesterday said the sack of the Vice- Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, followed due process and has come to stay. According to him, the Vice-Chancellor was removed from office by the Governing Council at an emergency meeting of Council held in Abuja on Wednesday for gross misconduct, particularly and reckless mismanagement of the finances of the university. Babalakin, who spoke yesterday during a press conference at the MMA2, Ikeja, Lagos on his arrival from Abuja, however, told journalists that there was no stalemate on the issue, insisting the university would come out stronger after the issue. The chairman, who also insisted that the termination of appointment of Vice-Chancellor was done in the interest of the students and university community, said: “There is no crisis at UNILAG, but what the university is facing is a vocal minority benefitting extensively from the university in what has become a cultural thing and which we want to stop.” Babalakin, who pointed out that the Council did not appoint any of the Deputy Vice-Chancellors as Acting Vice-Chancellor, said “to my understanding and knowledge UNILAG has no Deputy Vice-Chancellor because their appointments did not get the approval of the Council. He also said the Vice-Chancellor was served with all the allegations levelled against him and given enough time to defend himself, and which he actually did. The pro-Chancellor, who added that as a product of law he could not have done anything unlawful or illegal, said he was surprised that Prof. Ogundipe could now be pretending as if he was not given the opportunity to defend himself.
