Ikeja Lions Club, in conjunction with Ikeja Harmony of the International Lions Club, District 404B2, recently planted trees to help improve the environment, as part of their July service project.  At the tree planting exercise, which took place at the Lagos State Technical and Vocational College, Agindingbi, Lagos, about 100 pieces of different types of trees were planted under the supervision of the club’s District Governor, Lion Ademola Adesoye.
