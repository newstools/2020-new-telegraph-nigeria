Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday distributed empowerment materials to people with phisical disabilities and special needs in Lagos State. The governor described the gesture as part of his administration’s Greater Lagos Agenda. According to Sanwo-Olu, his administration remains committed to leaving nobody behind in its socio-economic development. The governor, who spoke through the Commissioner for Youths and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu, said the people with special needs would adequately be catered for by the state government at all times. Presenting the items to the beneficiaries at a short ceremony held at the Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs, LASODA, Alausa Ikeja, the governor said the beneficiaries, drawn from various special peoples’ associations, had earlier been trained during a five-week programme in various vocations. Sanwo-Olu said the beneficiaries were trained in various vocations such as bead making, ‘autogele,’ bag making, shoe making, cosmetology, electrical installation, tie and dye, graphics and design as well as hair dryer, sewing machines, and phone repair. He said: “It is a fact known to many of us here that until recently many governments and the society in the past had failed to develop ideal strategy by which PWDs could be meaningfully and indeed effectively integrated into their day to day policies and programme thereby giving them opportunities to prove to the world what they are capable of doing, thereby contributing to the growth and development of the system.”
