 Rapper Tray Savage is dead at the age of 26 after being shot in Chicago on Friday, The Sun can confirm.
The musician – who was a part of Chief Keef’s record label – died around 11 am after a person opened fire and struck Tray’s neck and shoulder, law enforcement told The Sun.
Law enforcement said the Got the Mac lyricist was driving when he was shot at, causing his vehicle to collide with three parked cars.
Tray was rushed to the University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead.
The Faces rapper was dropping his girlfriend off somewhere at the time he was struck with gunfire, the Chicago Sun Times reported.
Kentray “Savage” Young lived in the neighborhood where he was struck and killed, the publication claimed.
Police still do not have a suspect in custody and a homicide investigation is ongoing.
The Chicago native was a member of music label, Glory Boyz Entertainment, which was co-founded by Chief Keef.
Tray collaborated with his mentor on the 2013 track, Chiefin Keef – which became his most well-known song.
He grew a large following on YouTube from his music videos for Faces, Got the Mac and Know Who I Am.
Tray’s most recent release came from his 2019 album, MHGS.
Last month, the proud dad – who has a six-year-old son – celebrated his little girl’s birthday on Instagram with a JoJo Siwa-themed party.
“Twin Daddy love you babyyy my lil princes Happy Birthday im just happy.
“And blessed to be able to see s**t like this you getting big so fast give you wateva you need plus extra,” he wrote in the caption.
