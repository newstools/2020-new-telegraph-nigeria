Investments rise by 386%   INCREASE Telecommunications sector recorded a significant increase in foreign investments in the first quarter of this year   S ustaining the momentum gathered in 2019, the telecommunications sector attracted a total of $157.48 million in foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the first quarter of this year.   This represents a 386 per cent increase year-on-year when compared with the $32.35 million the sector recorded in Q1 2019.   The Q1 2020 figure also showed that the sector had performed better than in the preceding quarter (Q4 2019). According to the Capital Importation statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), quarter-on-quarter, foreign investments in the telecoms sector rose by 643 per cent as $21.17 was recorded in Q4 2019.   The investments in telecoms represented 2.69 per cent of the total capital importation into the country for the period under review.  NBS revealed that the total value of capital importation into Nigeria stood at $5.85 billion in the first quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 53.97 per cent compared to Q4 2019.   According to NBS, the largest amount of capital importation by type was received through portfolio investment, which accounted for 73.61 per cent ($4.3 billion) of total capital importation, followed by Other Investment, which accounted for 22.73 per cent ($1.33 billion) of total capital, and then Foreign Direct Investment FDI, which accounted for 3.66 per cent ($214.25 million) of total capital imported in Q1 2020.   For the first time in five years, the sector had recorded an increase in FDIs in 2019, as it attracted $944 million against $114.43 million recorded in 2018.   Despite the government’s sustained efforts at wooing foreign investors into telecoms, with broadband infrastructure at the heart of various international campaigns, the sector had witnessed a consistent decline in investments over the last four years. For instance, the $544.6 million attracted by the sector in 2017 was 42 per cent less than $931.2 million recorded in 2016. The sector also witnessed a marginal decline in 2016 as the figure went down by 0.7 per cent from $938.1 million recorded in the preceding year. In 2015, capital importation into the sector had decreased by 5.7 per cent from $994.3 million it got in 2014.   Stakeholders had blamed the past years’ downtrend in the sector on several challenges confronting players in the sector, noting that the environment was no longer conducive for more investments.   Specifically, President of the Association of Telecommunications Company of Nigeria (ATCON), Mr. Olusola Teniola, had expressed worry that the lull in foreign direct investment was also affecting operators’ efforts at deepening broadband penetration in the country.   Teniola emphasised that Nigeria, more than any other time, currently needs FDI in the telecom sector bridge infrastructure gap. According to him, Nigeria needs FDI to be able to bridge the gap of 225 markets/communities yet to receive or make a voice call. The people in those areas, he said, represent almost 20 million Nigerians without internet facilities.  “One of the things we need to do continuously is to ensure that we make our industry attractive to FDI by ensuring we have a very conducive and stable environment. The stable environment will mean that policies have to be consistent and seen to be working,” he said.   He urged the Federal Government to address all impediments to the growth of the telecom industry. The ATCON chief listed some of the obstacles as multiple taxation, destruction of telecommunications facilities, and multiple regulations.   He called for a good foreign exchange regime due to dependency on importation of hardware, software and some skills for the growth of the industry.b   Teniola also called for the proper execution of the Executive Order 5 recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari for ease of doing business in the sector.   “We need an increase in local content; the order will make this to happen, if well implemented. “For Nigeria to develop, we need skills and transfer of knowledge. These will encourage FDI,” he said.  The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had last year put total foreign direct and indirect investments in the telecoms sector since the liberalisation era at $70 billion, noting that this had helped the rapid growth of telecommunications in the country and boosted the sector’s contribution to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
