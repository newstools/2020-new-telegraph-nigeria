A police officer, Inspector Monday Gabriel, has been arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a sergeant at the Ikoyi area of Lagos State.   The suspect, who is attached to the Police Mobile Force, Squadron 21, Abuja, came to Lagos for a special duty with the victim, Sergeant Felix Okago.   The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said in a statement yesterday that on May 31, about 4:30p.m., Area ‘A’ Commander received a distress call that one inspector, who was on a special duty in a Federal Government facility in Ikoyi, went berserk and started shooting sporadically.   Elkana added that in the process of the shooting, Okago, who was also on a special duty with the inspector, was confirmed dead from the gunshot injuries.   He said: “In an attempt for the suspect to escape, he took a patrol van and headed towards Third Mainland Bridge, shooting as he was escaping. But was intercepted by policemen from Bariga Division along Akoka, where he was disarmed and then handcuffed.   “The rifle and vehicle used were recovered from him. The corpse of the deceased sergeant was later deposited in the mortuary for autopsy while the inspector was taken to Police Hospital for medical examination as he presented signs of mental depression.”   The PPRO added that the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of investigation to take over the probe.
