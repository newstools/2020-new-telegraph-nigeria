The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, shifted its governorship primary election to elect its candidate for the September 19 election in Edo State, following the planned defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki to the party today.
The exercise was earlier scheduled for today, but the National Vice Chairman (South-South) of the party, Chief Emmanuel Ogidi, who confirmed the shift, disclosed Tuesday, June 23 as a new date for the exercise.
It would be recalled that eggheads of the PDP have, for days, been engaged in extensive deliberations and negotiations with Obaseki and top aides of his government ahead of his much speculated defection to the party.
National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, who confirmed the postponement in a statement issued in Abuja, said the shift was “predicated on exigencies of party activities.”
The PDP has already communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the shift of its primary election.
A PDP source, who spoke with New Telegraph last night, disclosed that the governor might obtain his membership card of the party in his ward today.
Obaseki left the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday. He had held consultations with PDP governors and leaders shortly after his resignation.
Although some Edo youths bought the nomination form of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for the governor, but Obaseki has concluded plans to join the PDP.
“For the fact that the primary election is shifted tells you he is coming to PDP,” the source said. He could not, however, say when the governor would obtain his membership card.
Another source disclosed that the governor might obtain his membership card in his ward in Edo State today. He quoted the state chairman of the party saying that they were expecting him any moment.
Obaseki met with PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus and other PDP leaders on Wednesday night.
