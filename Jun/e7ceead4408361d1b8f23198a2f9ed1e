ASUU: Selection process to be free, fair, transparent
SSANU: VC to sustain varsity’s excellence, enhance workers’ welfare The race for the University of Ibadan (UI) Vice-Chancellorship post, which was announced few weeks ago, is already gathering momentum.
The authorities of the Nigeria’s premier university are searching for a new Vice-Chancellor that will succeed Prof. Idowu Abel Olayinka, whose five-year single term expires on December 1, this year, as the 12th substantive Vice-Chancellor of the institution. No fewer than seven renowned scholars from the university had already indicated interest to jostle for the plump job in the 72-year-old ivory tower.
According to stakeholders, the candidate, who emerged after the selection process, should be able uphold the tenets of the institution, sustain its vision, reposition and transform the ivory tower as a 21st Century institution of academic excellence of global reckoning. Some critical stakeholders, comprising the various workers’ unions, members of the university community, as well as the students, however, called for transparent process on the part of the Selection Committee, but insisted that whoever emerges as the next Vice-Chancellor should be a torch-bearer, and a scholar of integrity who should be able to uphold the tenets of the university for high standard, and conduct its affairs in line with the 21st Century needs. With the vision “to be a world-class institution for academic excellence geared towards meeting societal needs,” and mission “to expand the frontiers of knowledge through provision of excellent conditions for learning and research,” the university is set to create excellent academic and research environment for effective teaching, learning and researching and to make it a world class university, through the use of the instrumentality of research, intelligence gathering and community synergy to curb cultism and other social ills on campus. The next Vice-Chancellor, the stakeholders based on their expectations, said should be ready to intenalise the culture of academic excellence, discipline and long standing standard of the university. But, given the ongoing industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) of the institution, there are indications that the strike might slowed down the momentum of the process of obtaining and submitting application forms by interested candidates, which is still on till July 9. Despite this, the university chapter of ASUU, however, called on the Selection Committee to ensure transparent process that its outcome would bring in a cosmopolitan scholar of international repute, high academic standing, integrity and commitment to re-energise the focus of the ivory tower. While reacting to the process, the ASUU-UI Chairman, Prof. Ayo Akinwole, who recalled that though union is currently on strike, said: “We are on industrial action presently and so there is little that can be talked about the process, what we can do now is to pray that the process will be free and fair, while whoever emerges at the end will do well for the collective interest of our university. The ASUU leader, who reiterated that whichever candidate that emerged as the next Vice-Chancellor is not answerable to the union, but to his employer and the public, however, pointed out that the union’s expectations is that he or she should live above board and consolidate on the standard of the university. Akinwole further added: “Our expectation is that he or she should take the institution to the next level in academic and physical development in line with the aspirations of its founding fathers, as well as improve on whatever achievements he met on ground. “Nevertheless, we are strongly in expectation that the next Vice-Chancellor must improve the welfare of staff and students, and also bolster the age-long corporate image of the institution.
“As critical stakeholder and keen observer of the process, we shall ensure that whoever emerges will be properly monitored to guarantee that the rights and welfare of workers, students and other members of the university community are not trampled upon. And, these are our expectations.” Meanwhile, the university chapter of SSANU told New Telegraph that “the tenure of the outgoing Vice-Chancellor had been eventful; it added that Prof. Olayinka has done his bit.
This was as the Chairman of the union, Comrade Wale Akinremi, noted that the fact must be acknowledged that University of Ibadan is more a complex system in terms of governance than any other tertiary institution in the country. The SSANU chair, who said that the association had several unresolved issues with the outgoing Vice-Chancellor, noted: “As a union leader, I can attest to the fact that we still have a lot of axe to grind with his administration. I can say authoritatively that we are not satisfied with the attention and welfare we received from the outgoing Vice-Chancellor. Though, many factors could be attributed to that, the bottom line is that for the non-teaching members of staff, we were treated with disdain by the Prof. Olayinka’s administration. “We have to fight all the times to force management to meet our demands such as staff promotions; for our legitimate allowances to be paid, and for again the UI International Staff School teachers were treated like third class citizens under Prof. Olayinka, even after a court judgement had reinstated them. “More worrisome is that our security members of staff have been dying in droves for lack of annual leave, even while study leave became practically impossible for the non-teaching staff.”
Akinremi, who regretted that the relationship between the Vice-Chancellor and the non-teaching members of staff had broken down completely, irretrievably, wondered also that hardly would a non-teaching member of staff returned from the SDC (Staff Disciplinary Committee) unscathed. On the union’s expectations from the incoming Vice-Chancellor, SSANU insisted that the next Vice-Chancellor should a leader that will belong to all members of the community and not a particular group of workers. He said: “We expect the next Vice-Chancellor to be a good listener. We need a Vice-Chancellor who is going to assure the non-teaching staff that we are all critical stakeholders in the university project. He or she must be able to motivate the workers. In fact, we pray to have a charismatic leader, who is not going to wait for crisis to loom before engaging the workers positively. “Ultimately, we need a Vice-Chancellor, who is not going to be satisfied with the current rating of University of Ibadan as the best in Nigeria, but someone that will put every ingredient into making the ivory tower to become the best in Africa and compete favourably with the best in the global community.”
To qualify for the selection, the University Registrar, Olubunmi Faluyi, said the would-be candidates are expected, among other things, possess a good university education and should be a proven, successful manager of human and material resources. He stated in a release signed by him: “In accordance with the provisions of the Universities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Decree No. 11 of 1993 (as Amended by Decree No. 25 of 1996) and by the Universities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1993 (Amendment) Act 2003 and Act 2012, the Governing Council of the University of Ibadan wishes to commence the process of filling the vacancy.
