Super Eagles assistant coach, Joseph Yobo, has said the Nigeria Professional Football League is strong enough to throw up players who can succeed in the senior national team but they (players) must come with the right mentality. There have been mounting calls for increased number of home-based players in the Super Eagles as the national team coach Gernot Rohr has come under intense pressure to look inwards as he continues to build his team. The German coach has managed to use only 23 players from the local league since he took over in 2016 and some pundits have accused him of not doing enough to develop the NPFL. However, Yobo believes many players in the domestic league are good enough to come into the team, but he admitted it has to be the ones with the right attitude and mentality. “But to say do we have good players? It is an absolute yes. Do we have players that can come true and fit into the national team? Yes. “These players that are good should come with a different mentality when they are invited to the national team – to the Super Eagles because it is different,” Yobo told Brila FM. The former Everton Football Club defender admitted that myriad of problems are bedeviling the league and a lack of television coverage is one of them which makes it very difficult for fans and national team selectors to see and assess the players.. “The league is good enough and we have good players, we have very good players. Look at my era as well, how many players came into the national team (from the league). But it is all the decision of the coaches. Yobo replaced Imama Amapakabo as the assistant coach of the Super Eagles in January, but he’s yet to have a feel of his new position, thanks to coronavirus pandemic which has affected football activities all over the world.
