 Real Madrid have returned to the LaLiga summit, following a 2-0 win over Real Mallorca on Wednesday night.
Vinicius Junior opened scoring for Zinedine Zidaneâ€™s men in the first half with a fine chip.
Captain Sergio Ramos made it 2-0 with a fine free-kick, to secure maximum points for Real.
The victory sees Los Blancos on 68 points after 31 fixtures just like Barcelona.
However, Real are ahead of their bitter rivals on head-to-head record.
Barca travel to Celta Vigo on Saturday, while Madrid clash with Espanyol a day later.
