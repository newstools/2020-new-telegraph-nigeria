The House of Representatives yesterday said it would engage the 36 states Houses of Assemblies on the need for the domestication of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act and the Child Rights Act. Speaker, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, said the engagement would be technologically conducted due to the urgency and critical nature of the issue, considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the escalation of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls in the country. The Speaker disclosed this while hosting some sexual and gender-based Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in his office, where he added that the House would consider working on sexual violence-related laws to make them conform with the current realities. Some of the CSOs at the meeting include Women Advocacy Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Education as a Vaccine (EVA), Dorothy Njemanze Foundation, Rule of Law and Anti-corruption Programme, Action Aid, Malala Fund, Heir Women Development and Disability Rights Advocacy Centre, among others. He said: “My question has always been, first of all, why do we have this very significant uptick in cases of rape right now as opposed to in the past? “Is it because of cultural shift and people are now emboldened to report these cases? Or is it just actually an uptick, with more cases of rape? “I intend to write and communicate to all the Speakers of all 36 States for them to be proactive about this piece of legislation. Hopefully, we will set that up sometime next week to have a meeting, obviously by zoom conference with all the Speakers on a single item agenda.”
