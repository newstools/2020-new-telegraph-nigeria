In a renewed effort to contribute towards poverty alleviation and food security in the country, the University of Abuja (UNIABUJA) has planted 1,503 date palm seedlings on 12 hectares of land.
The exercise, which was carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), was also part of the university’s effort at creating a green campus and contributing to the nation’s economic development.
Flagging off the plantation at the main campus of the university, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, noted that more economic trees, such as teak, jatropha, oil palm, shea and mahogany, would also be planted.
Na’Allah, who said the students and the entire university would benefit greatly from the plantation, added that it was in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2 which targets empowerment and skill acquisition.
He noted: “We are delighted over the opportunity to formally launch this plantation of date palm on our campus. We want to have a green campus and I believe that there is no greater wealth than land. The university believes in the potential of agriculture not only as a source of food security, but to also generate revenue and change the fortunes of this country.”
The Vice-Chancellor, who stressed that the plantation would go a long way in facilitating teaching, however, pointed out that given the strategic location of the university, it was well-positioned to be a front-runner in agricultural research and development which his administration would continue to accord maximum support.
