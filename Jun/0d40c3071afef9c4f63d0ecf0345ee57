INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who addressed the opening session of the meeting, advised the parties to pay attention to the four mandatory requirements for eligibility of candidates for governorship elections as enshrined in Section 177 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).

He added that the person must be educated up to at least school certificate level or equivalent and must be sponsored by a political party.   The INEC Chairman warned that “there will be no extension of time for political parties that fail to submit the names and other details of the candidates that emerge from their primaries using the dedicated portal created by the commission.    “For emphasis, the deadline is 6p.m. on Monday 29th June 2020.”   He reminded head of security agencies that “while the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates will be the sole responsibility of political parties, our officials will monitor the primaries as required by law.”   Yakubu advised security agencies to remain proactive during the party primaries, electioneering, voting and eventual declaration of results.   “Doing so requires our professionalism and neutrality.
