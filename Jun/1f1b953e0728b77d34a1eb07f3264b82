Volatility in the overall economic and business climate has taken negative toll on earnings of Eterna Oil Plc.
Chris Ugwu writes  O il and gas sector of the Nigerian economy, like other sectors, has remained very challenging with enormous economic and securities issues.  The consequence of rapid naira devaluation and CODIV-19 outbreak have wiped out billions of naira in market capitalisation for Nigeria’s fledgling oil and gas companies.  Challenges of insecurity and other high costs of operations attributable to poor infrastructure have also continued to make the business operating environment difficult – especially the oil and gas sector of the economy. <img class="size-full wp-image-178311 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/Eterna-Oil.png?resize=640%2C298&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1" />  The industry has also continued to experience sustained pressure on its cash flow due to delay in payments of subsidies resulting in huge expenses.   Eterna Oil Plc, like others, has continued to get its fair share from the mixed fortune, as it continues to struggle under the pressure of high cost operating environment.  Market watchers attributed the situation primarily to the on-going weaker global commodity demand and pricing environment coupled with the rising refining expenditures. The oil firm’s earnings has been heavily hurt following increasing challenging operating milieu.  The oil marketer began the first quarter of year 2019 in a disappointing note, which served as a prelude to ending the year in the red.  According to analysts, the current overall results reflected Eterna Oil’s natural vulnerability to volume slowdown due to harsh environment following COVID-19 that is ravaging the world.   The share price closed at N2.67 per share at the closing of gong on Friday, reflecting the current market situation.

Challenges/way forward  According to reports, Eterna Oil’s Chairman, Shehu Dikko, recently announced to shareholders that the company was on course for a five-year strategic plan designed to take it to a higher level of success.   “As part of executing the plan, we acquired 14 additional retail outlets in 2018. We are consistently measuring our performance against set targets and the board is providing the oversight to ensure that management delivers on the plans,” Dikko told shareholders at the last annual general meeting in Lagos.   The chairman noted that the company remained committed to making sure its operations positively impact communities, which is the reason it keeps maintaining cordial relationship with all host communities, including youth groups, women groups, community development groups and paramount rulers.   Mahmud Tukur , Managing Director of Eterna Plc, said the company was expanding its downstream operations despite Nigeria’s challenging operating environment.   Making a case for the company’s downstream business, the company boss said Eterna Oil’s growth plan was based on a “longer-term vision” with the knowledge that actual profit margins are at the pumps or at the point of sale.   He said the company operated at high standards at par with the IOCs coupled with local knowledge of the operating environment, thereby giving it a competitive edge in its downstream operations.   “On this, let us first look at the rise of the super independents who have now become majors. We’ve seen new majors beyond the traditional Mobil, Total etc. Now the divestment is the fact that the operating environment is challenging, but as a local operator, we know how to operate in this environment,” he said.   Tukur said downstream deregulation was long overdue, and although a very political and sensitive issue, it has rather become imperative for industry growth.   Although he commended the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for their efforts on availability of products, he, however, noted that supply was still fraught with challenges and associated cost.   Tukur further said Eterna’s five-year strategic plan focused on three major areas – oil, lubricants and other new businesses, adding that despite the environmental challenges, the company is looking forward to acquiring additional 200 filling stations within the plan period.   He said apart from lubricant, which is Eterna’s mainstay, venturing into retail stations was part of the new focus, to be contracted through franchising, leasing, and acquisition, to double available capacity.   According to him, “we are not just acquiring stations; we are also getting strategic locations, where we can get value for money.”   He, however, expressed disappointment in supply inequality in the market, and accused NNPC of servicing mainly the majors and big names, which guarantees product availability to consumers.   To sustain expansion in the West African/ECOWAS sub-region, Tukur also unveiled plans to raise additional funds by way of debt or equities.   Last line   With the on-going weaker global commodity demand and pricing decline, many forecast that oil firms may take more time to settle unless government fast-track peoples’ oriented programmes to lift the economy from the state of despondency.
