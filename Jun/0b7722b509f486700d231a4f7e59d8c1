A rmed men, who disguised as patients, yesterday abducted a resident doctor, Wisdom Viotete, attached to the Central Hospital at Burutu, Ojobo, a coastal area of Delta State.   The early morning abduction by an eight-man gang has thrown members of the state chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) into confusion.   Although the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mordi Ononye, and the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba, Dr. Victor Osiatome, could not be reached, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the kidnap in Asaba.   The PPRO said the command had spread its dragnets to rescue the victim unhurt and arrest the perpetrators.   It was learnt that the kidnappers pretended that one of them was ill and required medical attention but later brought out their guns and abducted the victim.   “They feigned sickness as they came into the hospital about 12:30a.m. through unusual routes in the creeks. They claimed that one of them was sick and needed to run a test for malaria.  “Four of the kidnappers came inside the ward while others were inside the boat at the waterside but unknown to the medical workers. They held the nurse on duty and threatened to kill her if she raised the alarm.   “In the process, the criminals pulled out their guns and held the doctor and the laboratory technician. They marched the doctor into their waiting boat and zoomed off but the nurse managed to escape into the bush. The tension woke everybody on the premises,” a witness said.   The state NMA Chairman, Dr. Ekenam Omo, described the incident as “sad, inhuman and barbaric”.   Omo said the association had written to the security agencies to expedite action in rescuing their colleague from the den of kidnappers.
