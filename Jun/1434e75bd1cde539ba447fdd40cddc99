*Accredits three private hospitals as treatment centres Lagos recorded a significant drop in its COVID-19 toll on Saturday as the state confirmed 66 new cases.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced the cases at 11:38 pm on Saturday, when it confirmed 389 new cases in 22 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).
This is the first time in weeks that Lagos will record less than 100 cases in its daily case count.
With 130 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the number of recoveries increased from 3,696 to 3,826, while fatalities rose from 333 to 342.
A total of 12,233 COVID-19 cases have now been confirmed in 35 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).
Kebbi and Sokoto, which had no active COVID-19 case as of Friday, recorded new cases on Saturday.
Saturday marked 100 days since Nigeria recorded its index case on February 27, 2020.
A statement by the NCDC earlier on Saturday highlighted efforts by the agency, the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19 and state emergency operation centres to contain the spread of the virus.
“One hundred days after the first case, we remember all Nigerians who have passed away from the disease. We commiserate with their families and friends who have had to deal with the difficulty of losing loved ones at this time,” it read.
“To ensure a well-coordinated emergency response, NCDC activated a Level 3 Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on the 27th of February 2020. Prior to this, the National EOC was in alert mode; monitoring the spread in other countries, carrying out risk assessments and strengthening Nigeria’s preparedness.
“During this time, NCDC developed technical guidelines, response plans and trained health workers across the country. The National EOC includes representatives from the Federal Ministry of Health, other sister agencies and partners.
“Prior to the confirmation of the first case, NCDC supported four laboratories within its molecular laboratory network to activate testing for COVID-19. Since then, the number of laboratories has increased to 30, with a combined minimum capacity of 10,000 tests daily. The goal is to expand to at least 10 more laboratories by the end of June, leveraging on Gene-Xpert capacity for Tuberculosis diagnosis.”
Meanwhile, Lagos State Government has accredited three private hospitals to manage COVID-19 cases in the state.
A statement from the Lagos State Ministry of Health quoted the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, as disclosing this at a news briefing to give situation report on COVID-19 management in the state.
Abayomi stressed that one of the accredited private hospitals is already admitting patients, adding that the other two will soon start admission and management of patients.
He said: “They have passed the biosecurity compliance test. They have made modifications to their hospitals so that their staff and other patients are not put in danger or exposed to a higher risk of contracting COVID-19.
“Those private hospitals have passed the test and we are just in the process of issuing them with accreditation certificate so that they can start managing COVID19 patients in the private sector.
“However, even if they are managing COVID19 in the private sector, it still comes under the supervision of the Lagos State Government Ministry of Health.
“Also, information about every patient managed by the hospitals must be made available to us so that we can record it in our database.
“COVID-19 remains a public crisis and all public crises are managed and supervised by the Lagos state government and by extension the federal government of Nigeria,” Abayomi said.
The names of the private facilities were not given in a copy of the press release obtained by our correspondent.
