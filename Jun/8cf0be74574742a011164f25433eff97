U nited States Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, on Tuesday, spoke with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, on telephone, to discuss the roles of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and multilateral initiatives in accelerating economic recovery and regional security.   A statement issued by the Office of the US Department of State Spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus, said Pompeo and Onyeama agreed that transparency and accountability would drive democratic and inclusive development.   Recall that Nigeria’s Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, who is the President of the bank, had been in the eye of the storm over allegations of impropriety levelled against him by some whistle blowers working in the bank.   Although Adesina was given a clean bill of health by the bank’s Ethics’ Committee in its report which was accepted by the Board of Governors, some AfDB non regional stakeholders, notably the United States, rejected the report and demanded a fresh probe by an independent body.   The statement said: “They (Pompeo and Onyeama) also discussed the AfDB and the constructive role of multilateral initiatives in accelerating economic recovery and regional security, and they agreed that transparency and accountability will drive democratic and inclusive development.”   It also said the U.S. condoled with Nigeria over the recent ISIS West Africa attacks in the North-East which claimed lives. The duo also reviewed Nigeria’s progress in fighting COVID-19 and the $30 million U.S. assistance which has helped strengthen the nation’s public health sector.
