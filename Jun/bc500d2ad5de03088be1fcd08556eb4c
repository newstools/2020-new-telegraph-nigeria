We are moving towards the peak of the infection in Bayelsa State. The number will continue to increase until it will stabilize. “It will straighten up and deepen. By the time it deepens, then we are out. “In the course of this a lot of people are going to be infected. The surveillance team will pick them out get them tested treated isolated quarantined and all of that will be done.” Urging them to confine themselves to the COVID-19   protocols, he said: “Bayelsans should not be afraid.

The Task Force Chairman said: “Shell brought in the most modern PCR equipment. It is to get people trained, get a few cabinets and a few reagents. Once we set it up, we now bring in the NCDC. By the end of the month, we should be inviting NCDC to come and look at it and certify the place. Once that is done, we are good to go.” He, however, cautioned that some churches are not adhering to the COVID-19 protocols and advised them to do so.
