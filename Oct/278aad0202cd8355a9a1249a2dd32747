Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, has said that his side can take plenty of lessons from their 1-0 loss to African champions Algeria on Friday night after reassembling his team for the first time in 11 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AOIFootball.com reports.  Without the duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Victor Osimhen, Rohr handed debut starts to Zaidu Sanusi and Frank Onyeka with Maduka Okoye getting his debut start in goal, whilst Semi Ajayi was deployed as a makeshift defensive midfielder.
