Meanwhile, Governor Akeredolu has described his victory at the poll as the statement of the people’s assessment of the performance of his administration in the last three and a half years. According to the governor, the support he got from the people of the state was a reward for hard work, dedication and patriotism.  Akeredolu, in his victory speech, stated that: “The renewal of our mandate in this election is an eloquent testimony to the degree of acceptance by you, the good people of Ondo State. “It affirms that the confidence reposed in our administration remains unshaken. It is a statement on your assessment of our performance in the last three and a half years. It is unequivocal, direct, inspiring and soul lifting.   “It is awesome. It is a reward for hard work, dedication, focus, honesty and patriotism. It is also a challenge to us for rededication to service in the interest of our people. On this, we shall not relent.” The governor added that: “We set out on the first leg of this political adventure with the determination to make the whole state our constituency. We have not relented on our mission to bridge the huge infrastructural deficit inherited on assumption of office.  “We hold the axiom as evident that the welfare of the people should be the only justification for the existence of government. We have allowed this admonition to be the guiding principle of governance. We are elated to receive a scorecard through this state-wide plebiscite.  “The resounding victory of our great party, the APC, throws an open challenge to all stakeholders not to choose the path of complacency. We have noted the few dissenting voices of protest in this referendum. We heard them loud and clear. We intend to address genuine grievances. We shall continue to focus on the development of our God-given space, the Sunshine State.”  Following the conclussion of the Edo State governorship election, attention has shifted to Ondo State, where governorship poll will hold on October 10.
