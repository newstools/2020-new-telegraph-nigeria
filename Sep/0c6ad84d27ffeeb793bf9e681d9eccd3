  The Federal Government has spent a total of N8.94 trillion on oil subsidy between 2006 and 2015, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has said.  The agency disclosed this in a document on subsidy payment released in Abuja yesterday. It said that the subsidy was paid to oil marketers and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in the period under review.  A breakdown of the money indicated that in 2006, a total of N257.36 billion was paid, in 2007, N271.51 billion while in 2008 N630.57 billion was paid to marketers. “Also, oil marketers in 2009 were paid N409.31 billion and N667.08 billion in 2010 respectively as subsidy claims,” it said.  The document further revealed that in the year 2011, Federal Government paid a total of N2,105.92 trillion, an increase of N1,437.84 trillion from 2010 payment. The PPPRA, in the document, noted that in 2012, N1.35 trillion was paid as subsidy.  “A total of N1,316.63 trillion in 2013, N1,217.35 trillion in 2014 and N653.51 billion in 2015 was paid as subsidy claims,” it added.
