They were given the power to debit loans and accrued interests due from bank accounts of loan defaulters across the banking system. The NBS data also revealed that a total of 2.2 billion volume of transactions, valued at N263.78 trillion, was recorded in Q2 2020 through electronic Payment Channels in the Nigeria Banking Sector.
