 Few days after making a video advising how to stay better protected with face masks, Nigerian fashion brand, Ugo Monye has produced over 3000 breathable, washable face masks to aid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
With the outbreak of Covid-19, which has brought about a perturbing health crisis in the country, the creative director saw the demand for face masks increasing, so he created his own to give away for free.
Lately, many Nigerian fashion designers have taken it upon themselves to make face masks at their free time and share to the public to help fight against coronavirus pandemic.
The masks, which are a protective measure against the novel coronavirus that is spreading across the country, were made from 100-percent cotton fabric. Although, the cotton masks may not be medically certified but they are far better than nothing.
Ugo Monye, staff and friends were mobilised for the distribution after the brand felt duty bound to support the community. So far, about 700 of these masks have been distributed to people at the popular Lagos Island market and also at the Tafawa Balewa Square BRT terminal. The designer also visited a police station to deliver masks to the police staff.
Not only were the masks shared among these people, the Creative Director of the eponymous brand Ugo Monye also took his time to inform them about the importance of wearing a face mask and also how to maintain it.
He explained that sharing of face masks can never be enough because its is necessary for each person to have at least five to six masks.
Ugo Monye is the fashion designer that made the famous agbada worn by Ebuka Uchendu that caused a stir at Banky W and Adesua’s traditional wedding.
