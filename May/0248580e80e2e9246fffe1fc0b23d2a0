 From Muhammad Kabir, Kano  In order to ensure strict compliance of the coronavirus safety protocols by all Kano Jumaat Mosques, which are now allowed to open, the administration of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has deployed the state’s Sharia Police to the places of worship. The adopted guidelines that have allowed the reopening of the mosques, which have been padlocked for almost four weeks, according to Muhammad Garba, the state’s Commissioner for Information, includes ensuring wearing of face masks by every worshiper and the maintaining of social distancing while worshipping. However, even before they are allowed to enter the mosques, worshippers are to use hand sanitizers while the vicinity of the building must be clean. The commissioner said as a way of fine tuning the recently extended lockdown of Kano State by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for another two weeks, the state released the operational guidelines for the controlled easing of the pandemic-induced restriction. Malam Garba, who issued the statement, after a marathon meeting with the Ullamas last night, said government is fully aware of the difficult but necessary hardship people have to pass through which informed the need for controlled enforcement. He said after series of meetings with key health experts, the Ulama and other stake holders, the state government adopted some measures that will further bring relief to the populace, with the partial lift on the lockdown on three days, that is, Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays between 10:00am and 2:00pm with a total relief of 12 hours per week as earlier recommended by the Presidential Task Force. Malam Garba said Governor Ganduje had directed the state Hisbah Board to hold meetings with Imams and deploy its personnel to Friday (Jumu’at Mosques) across the state to ensure that worshipers comply with personal hygiene through maintaining social distancing, hand washing with soap, use of hand sanitizers and face masks. The commissioner also said that government considered it convenient to allow the conduct of Eid Prayers on the Sallah day in all the five Emirates in the state during which restriction of movement has been lifted from 6:00am to 2:00pm under strict observance of safety and prevention protocols. He, however, said that there will be no Sallah festivities in all the Emirates, including visits to Gidan Shettima, Hawan Daushe, Hawan Nassarawa and Hawan Dorayi in Kano and all other similar traditional Sallah celebrations in the four other Emirates.
