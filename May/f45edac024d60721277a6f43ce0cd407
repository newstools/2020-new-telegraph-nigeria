The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), yesterday, which declared this in its latest report on petroleum products importations statistics for 2019, maintained that the high volume of the product’s import was buoyed by inefficiency of local refining capacity. The country, NBS noted,also imported 5.15 billion litres of Automotive Gas (AGO) known as diesel, and 128.11 million litres of Household Kerosene (HHK) known as kerosene in the period under review. Also, 1.07 billion littres of Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) were imported as well as 45.98 million litres of Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO). It added that 526.06 million litres of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cooking gas were imported into the country in the year under review.
