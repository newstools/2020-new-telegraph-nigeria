 *Airline to make refunds  Wole Shadare  The Nigeria High Commission in Canada has given reasons why the planned evacuation of Nigerians from Canada by Air Peace may not come to fruition. Consequently, the High Commission says it is working assiduously to secure an alternative arrangement to take Nigerians stranded in Canada home as soon as possible, safely and at the least cost possible, adding that updates would be communicated in due course. In a letter dated May 20, 2020 with reference: NHT/OTT/ADM.56/1, titled: “Update on the flight postponement” , the mission explained that it engaged a number of airlines and eventually came up with an arrangement and pricing structure with Air Peace which no other airline was able to match. It further explained that its public notice of May 12, 2020, the High Commission announced that the Canadian government had expressed reservations concerning the granting of the necessary clearance/landing permit for Air Peace to fly into Canada, due to safety concerns. After protracted engagement, the Mission said the Canadian government: “Has unfortunately reverted with what appears to be a final refusal. As a result, the Air Peace arrangement is hereby cancelled.” It hinted that during the negotiation with Air Peace, the issue of refunds was addressed in the event that the flight did not hold due to unforeseen circumstances and as such, everyone will get refunds for their tickets from Air Peace Limited as agreed.
