Two persons were killed on Saturday while one other sustained injuries in a fatal crash at the Ota Old Toll Gate along the Abeokuta-Lagos Expressway.  The accident, which occurred about 12:37pm, involved three vehicles, including a truck belonging to a popular cement company.  Spokesperson of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ogun State Command, Florence Okpe, confirmed the incident in a statement made available to reporters in Abeokuta.  Okpe stated that two male adults died in the crash while a female victim, who was also involved, was rescued for medical treatment at the State Hospital Ota.  She attributed the accident to mechanical deficiency caused by brake failure of one of the accidented vehicles.  She said: “The crash involved three vehicles. The first is a white coloured MACK tanker with no registration number. The second vehicle is a red coloured MACK truck with registration number AAA448XJ.  “The third vehicle is a HOWO truck belonging to a cement company with registration number GN7248-16.   “The suspected cause of the fatal crash is mechanical deficiency caused by brake failure by the MACK truck with registration number AAA448XJ,  conveying a container, that failed brake as it drove towards Lagos but lost control and overran the road divider to crash into the other two trucks travelling in opposite direction.”   Okpe disclosed that the remains of the dead victims were subsequently deposited at the Ifo General Hospital mortuary and the obstructions cleared for free flow of traffic.
