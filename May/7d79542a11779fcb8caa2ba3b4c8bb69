S imeon Nwakaudu, the special assistant on Electronic Media to Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, died in Port Harcourt yesterday during a brief illness. Nwakaudu, who was actively on duty since the state government waged war against the spread of coronavirus, died of undisclosed ailment at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH). Wike has expressed shock over Nwakaudu’s sudden death. He described the deceased “as a loyal and dedicated professional who contributed immensely to the implementation of the the New Rivers Vision.” The governor, who spoke in a statement through the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Pastor Paulinus Nsirim, on behalf of his family, the government and good people of the state, condoled with the bereaved family. He prayed God to grant Simeon’s family “the fortitude to bear the great loss”.
