T he Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has described the Minister for Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare, as a real blessing to the sport of athletics and indeed all sports since he was made the number one sportsman in Nigeria last August.   In a congratulatory message to the minister on Friday on the occasion of his 54th birthday, the AFN through its president, Olamide George, hailed Dare as a visionary leader. The AFN president thanked the minister for his bold move at reviving long distance running in Nigeria.   “The AFN and indeed all sports federations in Nigeria are blessed to have a man of vision as sports minister since August 21, 2019,” George said.   “He has redefined sports administration in Nigeria and has made it a business model attractive once again to corporate Nigeria.   “The mark of a true visionary is his ability to imagine the future and act on it, yielding great results in the process and then using this success for the benefit of others.   “The story over the years has always been that Nigeria can rival the East Africans in long distance races if only we can expose the athletes to altitude training but no sports minister has made any real move towards making this a reality until Honourable Dare became Sports Minister.   “Hope has now been rekindled with the intervention of the Minister and in no distant future, Nigerian athletes will not only be battling for Olympic medals in the middle and long distance races up to the marathon, we will also be able to have youths making money competing in World Athletics labelled road races across the globe.”
