 Arsenal midfielder Dani Ceballos has claimed that the Premier League will officially return on June 20.
England’s top flight has been halted since March 9 and all 20 clubs have been involved in extensive negotiations to discuss how the season can be completed safely.
Germany’s Bundesliga was the first major league in Europe to return last weekend, while Spain’s La Liga is targeting June 12 for its comeback, reports metro.co.uk.
And Ceballos has revealed that Arsenal, who were due to play away to Manchester City on March 11 before the match was postponed in response to the coronavirus outbreak, are working towards the Premier League’s return date of June 20.
“We are going to start a week late with respect to what is being talked about in Spain, which is June 12, and we are going to start the league on the 20th,” Ceballos said in an interview with ‘RTVE’.
Across Sunday and Monday, the Premier League carried out 748 Covid-19 tests on players and staff with six people testing positive, including three at Watford. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta contracted coronavirus in March but Ceballos has revealed that everyone at the club tested negative following the first round of mass testing this week.
“48 hours ago we passed the tests and the truth is that the entire team have given a negative result,’’ said the midfielder.
Ceballos is currently on loan at Arsenal from Real Madrid and the midfielder reiterated his desire to challenge for a place in Zinedine Zidane’s side next season.
“I am a Real Madrid player… and any player in the world would like to play for Real Madrid,” Ceballos told ‘TVE’ on Wednesday. “I have a contract with them for three more years and they are the ideal team to succeed.”
