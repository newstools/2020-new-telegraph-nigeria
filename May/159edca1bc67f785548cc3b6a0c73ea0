Weak macro-economic environment and its multiplier effect on business operating environment is taking a toll on profit margin of Portland Paints and Products Nigeria Plc. Chris Ugwu writes  T he marketing environment has continued to be turbulent in Nigeria, especially the manufacturing sector, due largely to effect of oil price fluctuations and yet to be resolved infrastructural challenges, multiple  taxation  and  high  cost  of  operation  arising  from    adverse  fiscal and monetary policy, inflation  and high cost of funds and recent Coronavirus pandemic.   Again, the security landscape remains a major concern in some parts of the country making free enterprise increasingly complicated in the affected states.   Rising cost and in some cases scarcity of key raw materials has become a thorn in the flesh of most companies operating in Nigeria.   The trend, which is reflective of the weak macro-economic environment, has had its multiplier effect on general liquidity within the system and investor appetite and also resulted in many companies experiencing declining purchasing power and competitive pressures leading to only minimal retail price increases, despite accelerating costs.  The consumer is significantly stretched as inflationary pressures weighed heavily on purchasing power.   The cheaper price of imported goods is also blamed for the penchant of Nigerians to patronise imported goods to the detriment of locally produced goods. This is why many local industries, including paints manufacturers, that cannot stand the heat of the competition in the same market with imported goods are fast disappearing from the industrial landscape.  Also, domestic constraints such as depletion of fiscal buffers, dwindling foreign reserves, among others have remain hydra headed monster to the business operating environment.   Market watchers also believe that for the paint industry to survive, more is needed to be done in order to totally curb the problem of counterfeiting. Individual companies must also be able to come up with innovations that will help counter the activities of counterfeiters.   Portland Paints and Products Nigeria Plc, a subsidiary of UAC of Nigeria Plc, which had good outing in the last few years, had since last year joined others to witness  drop in  earnings as both the governments and private companies struggle to meet obligations.   This is on the back of rising operational costs as a result of a severe dollar shortage that forced manufacturers to buy dollars from inaccessible black market.   Market watchers also believe that for the paint industry to survive, more is needed to be done in order to totally curb the problem of counterfeiting.  With impressive showing in 2017 and 2018 as regards growth in profit, analysts expected that Portland Paints would sustain the profit margin but the company for the past one year has continued to battle with rising cost of production brought on by scarcity/ high cost of raw materials and high energy cost as cost of sales and also selling and distribution expenses and recently CODIV-19 .   Reflecting the general trend  in value of shares quoted on the floor of the Nigerian stock market following low investor confidence, the share price stood at N2.23 per share at close of gong on Friday.
