  These are certainly not the best of times for the good looking Man of God and the General Overseer of Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakilome, as the graduate from Ambrose Ali University Ekpoma is presently under heavy attacks from members of the public, following his outburst.   Following the continuing shot down of churches, among other public gatherings in the bid to check the spread of dreaded corona virus, the light skinned Man of God took swipe on other men of God who according to him, failed to see prayer as an option, thereby allowed government to shut the churches. He alleged that other pastors who consented to closing down of the churches never had Christ as their Lord.   This in turn has brought Chris under attacks of all kinds. While some see him as a man who is frustrated because he has not been happy since the churches were shut down. Some others felt there is a need to query his mental capability, if he could be bold enough to publicly disagree with the directive to shut down churches temporarily. As it is, fingers are being crossed to see where the whole thing would end, as other Men of God are expected to take up Chris for calling them out.   Oyakhilome, it will be recalled had earlier made a position that the coronavirus did not exist, thereby backing a theory that there was a conspiracy about 5G wireless connection.    The Oregun, Lagos-based pastor, however, ended up a laughing stock when other Men of God, through verifiable facts discarded the 5G conspiracy theory and established that coronavirus was real.
