The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will soon present the resolution of the National Council on Privatization (NCP) on power and healthcare reforms to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council (FEC). According to a statement made available to newsmen yesterday by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo presided over the NCP where power sector issues and comprehensive healthcare reforms were tabled. He stated: “Significantly, NCP today (yesterday) approved the preparation and presentation to Mr. President and FEC, a draft legislative instrument to enact the Health Sector Reform Bill and associated legislation. “The critical point here is that this Buhari administration’s proposed reforms will ensure that several millions of Nigerians who can’t afford to pay for it, would begin to receive efficient healthcare services once the new system takes off.” Members of NCP include several federal ministers, the Central Bank governor and the directorgeneral of the Bureau of Public Enterprises who is the secretary of the Council.
