Leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, threatened to sue security agents for continued detention and torture of four of its members by Air Force personnel, DSS and the police in Owerri, Imo State. According to him, the MASSOB members were arrested at the Emmanuel College Junction, Owerri, for allegedly wearing face caps with the inscription of Biafra rising sun. Uwazurike alleged that the four members of the group were initially detained at the Nigeria Air Force base at Naze, after they were allegedly given machetes to cut grasses in front of the Air Force base. In a statement issued and signed by his Media Assistant, Elder Chris Mocha, the group said: “On May 20, the Air Force personnel handed them over to Directorate of State Security Services (DSS) office along Onitsha-Owerri Road and were later moved to State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Owerri, where they were beaten to a pulp.” According to him, the DSS officials after beating them to their satisfaction handed them over to the Imo State’s commissioner of police who finally clamped them into detention and refused to admit them to bail till date. He also demanded the immediate release the members who did not breach any known law or charge them to court without any further delay.
