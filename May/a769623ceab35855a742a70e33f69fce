C hairman of the Nigeria Football FederationTechnical and Development Committee, Ahmed Yusuf ‘Fresh’, has denied ever collected any funds amounting to N10m from the federation.  An online site, scorenigeria.com.ng recently posted a story that the sum of N10m was paid into the personal account of the board member, as the website accused the Amaju Pinnick-led NFF of corruption.   The site further revealed that the N10m was paid on two installments to Fresh’s account in the month of March.   In a quick reaction by the media aide of the former chairman of NFF Referee Committee, Olaoluwa Aro, the board member never collected or used his account for such transactions.   “As a reputable media and sports agency, we have done our investigation and discovered all the things published by scorenigeria.com.ng in relation to our client Ahmed Yusuf ‘Fresh’ were unfounded,” Aro said.   “It’s very disturbing because scorenigeria.com.ng is one of the media outlets that enjoys traducing in the name of investigative journalism.   “We are saying this without ambiguity that, our client, Yusuf did not receive any money from the NFF as published by scorenigeria.com.ng. For clarity; Ahmed Yusuf Fresh’s account was not credited with any N10m as stated in the publication.”   They however called for the website to conduct their investigations properly and also retract the reports within the shortest period of time.
