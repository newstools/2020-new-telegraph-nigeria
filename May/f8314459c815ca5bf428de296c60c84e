Several months back, former Chief of Staff to the former governor of Imo State, who doubled as a son in-law to the same governor, Uche Nwosu was not nothing short of man of the moment as everyone swarmed around him because it all looked like he was going to be the next governor of the state.   But with all the dream now down the drain and the man who was least expected to be the governor, Hope Uzodinma now the man of the moment, the story of Senator Rocaha’s Okoroch’s son in-law, Uche, is now like of a star that briefly, brilliantly illuminated the sky before losing its light and fading suddenly into relative nothingness.    Having had his 15 minutes of fame on the political scene, Uche now has to contend with being ignored and marooned.   It will be recalled that the Imo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) became a battlefield as Okorocha tried to impose Nwosu on the people. An action fervently resisted by the national leadership of the party who pronounced Senator Hope Uzodinma the party’s standard-bearer.   This led Okorocha to lead Nwosu and other disgruntled elements into the Action Alliance from which platform the latter contested and lost the gubernatorial election to Honorable Emeka Ihedioha of Peoples Democratic Party who the court eventually sacked for the present occupant of the coveted seat, Senator Uzodinma.
