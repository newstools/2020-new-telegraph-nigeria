 From: Cephas Iorhemen, Makurdi The Benue State government Saturday made a U-turn and reversed its decision to reopen worship centres, markets and public places.
Governor Ortom on Thursday, lifted its ban on religious gathering and as well as markets and directed both churches and mosques to begin to hold staggered worship sessions just as civil servants on grade levels 1 to 12 were also asked to resume work on June 1.
But addressing newsmen in his office at Government House in Makurdi, Govenor Ortom said the decision became imperative to abide by the advice of the Federal Government and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) as well as other religious bodies against reopening of worship centres and other public places.
Ortom stated that Benue is part of the Nigerian federation and it is working in collaboration with relevant federal agencies including the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
