The rising number of coronavirus(Covid-19) cases in the country continues to underline the need for more support for the federal and state governments’ efforts to tackle the crisis. In this report, PAUL OGBUOKIRI  writes about the partnership between Global Citizen and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) to launch a fund that seeks to raise billions of naira from Nigerians at home and abroad to combat the pandemic and other public health challenges   A ll over the world, the devastating impact of the coronavirus(Covid-19) pandemic has led to increased collaboration between  business and political leaders as part of efforts to deal with the crisis. Thus, in addition to some of the interventions already announced by various groups, Global Citizen, an international citizens’ action-led advocacy organisation that is working with the United Nations is partnering with the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) to launch a Covid-19 Solidarity Fund in Nigeria.   The virtual press conference to announce the Fund was held recently and had the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, Chairman of Global Citizen in Nigeria, Mr. Tunde Folawiyo, Vice Chairman, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede and Global Citizen Chief Policy Officer, Mr. Michael Sheldrick as participants.   <img class="size-full wp-image-177913 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/ig-Imoukhuede-Orji.png?resize=611%2C311&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="611" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1" />The Chairman of the Board of Directors, NSIA, Mr. Jide Zeitlin and Managing Director of NSIA, Mr. Uche Orji also participated at the conference which was moderated by a former BBC Journalist, Ms. Kadaria Ahmed. According to Mr. Folawiyo, the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund, which was designed to provide additional support for Nigeria’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, will enable Nigerian citizens, resident at home or in the diaspora, as well as international donors, to come together and directly contribute to Nigeria’s fight against the pandemic.   He noted that although many private organisations and individuals have contributed money and materials  to support Federal and State governments’  efforts  to tackle the pandemic in the last three months,  none of the contributions has taken the form and shape of what Global Citizen and NSIA have put in place in terms of structure and scope.   In fact, before the outbreak of Covid-19, Global Citizen Nigeria at a Policy Dialogue held in December 2019 in Lagos, unveiled a plan to intervene in Primary Healthcare delivery in 774 local governments in the country. Thus, according to Mr. Aig-Imoukhuede, the Covid-19 pandemic has made the intervention more compelling.   The Global Citizen Nigeria Vice Chairman also raised other public health challenges Nigeria and Africa still face like Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and Tuberculosis all of which, he said, require attention. He noted that over 500,000 HIV/AIDS patients have not been able to access treatment since the outbreak of Covid-19 in many African countries because government efforts across the continent have shifted to combating the scourge of coronavirus. He pointed out that the problem with this approach is that inability to provide antiretroviral treatments and other healthcare needs of these patients for up to a period of six months could result in deaths, almost at the scale African countries recorded over a decade ago.  Speaking at the briefing, the Vice President , Professor Yemi Osinbajo, said:  “The Government of Nigeria is delighted that the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), together with the world’s leading international advocacy organisation, Global Citizen, and their partners, have embarked on a process to set up a new funding vehicle. The Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund (NSSF) will provide support to our most vulnerable communities in the fight against Covid-19.”   Also speaking Board Chairman, NSIA, Mr. Jide Zeitlin, said:“As the SWF of the most populous country on the continent, it is important for the Board of the NSIA to support collaborations of this nature which further strengthens the nation’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The unprecedented challenge posed by the outbreak demands that we embrace flexibility as never before on partnerships with the right organisations to help mobilise support for the fund as well as building sustainable systems in our communities.” Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer of NSIA, Uche Orji said in his presentation at the briefing that coronavirus has already put a major strain on public health infrastructure coupled with dislocation it has caused for social and economic activities,  adding that working with the Global Citizen will help to bring much needed relief.   Orji said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has strained the nation’s health, social and economic systems, yet our resolve to work together to contain it remains unflinching. Against this background, we are thrilled to partner with Global Citizen in launching the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund, as the Fund Manager.”   He noted that the NSIA plays a leading role in driving Nigeria’s sustained economic development through the careful implementation of its three core mandates: building a savings base for the Nigerian people, development of infrastructure and providing stabilization in times of economic stress. According to him, the NSIA’s long term infrastructure investment strategy entails creating model tertiary healthcare facilities designed and equipped to international standards to reduce the foreign exchange burden of medical tourism and to develop domestic expertise in tertiary healthcare.   He added that the collaboration with Global Citizen will help extend the agency’s primary care footprint in healthcare, stressing that the Solidarity Support Fund will enable the expansion of primary health care, thereby improving access, building capacity, and enhancing the resilience of Nigeria’s health delivery, especially in rural and underserved communities.   In his contribution, Chief Policy Officer Global Citizen, Mr. Michael Sheldrick , said: “Global Citizen’s ongoing commitment to the African continent and, in particular, Nigeria is motivated by two key factors: The shift in geopolitical power towards emerging markets, and the recognition that developing countries want and need to have agency over their own development, this makes a presence in the sub-Saharan region vital to the long-term success of any initiative seeking to end extreme poverty.” In the same vein, Chairman Global Citizen Nigeria, Tunde Folawiyo, said:“As we embark upon our work in Nigeria, Global Citizen will mobilise Nigerians, Nigerians in the diaspora, global partners, together with the philanthropic and private sectors in our nation’s fight against Covid-19.”   “Our efforts must ensure that we are able to envision and meet the demands that will emerge in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is imperative as the nation adjusts to the realities of a changing economy, transitions to a “new normal” and embraces the Nigeria of the future,” Mr. Aig-Imoukhuede stated. Global Citizen is the world’s largest movement of action takers and impact makers dedicated to ending extreme poverty by 2030. With over 10 million monthly advocates, Global Citizen’s voices have the power to drive lasting change around sustainability, equality, and humanity. The organisation’s work with partners, the actions of its global community, along with high-level advocacy efforts, has resulted in commitments and policy announcements from world leaders valued at over $48 billion (N18.7 trillion), affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people across the globe by 2030.   According to its promoters, the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund will be incorporated as a non-government charitable foundation. In line with global best practices, it will be professionally managed and transparently governed through a strong Advisor Board comprising eminently qualified men and women to ensure that the funds are effectively used and properly accounted for.   “This stakeholder led-and-resourced mechanism will provide tools to augment ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19 in communities across Nigeria, as well as to strengthen health systems in the aftermath of the acute pandemic response.,” they said.   Specifically, they stated that the Fund  will target four core Covid-19 response, mitigation and recovery areas including: Supporting the most vulnerable populations; strengthening the domestic healthcare systems; expanding access to rural and community focused universal healthcare access and  re-skilling and re-tooling for the ‘New Nigerian Renaissance’ post Covid-19.
