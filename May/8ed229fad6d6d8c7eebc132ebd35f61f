 A t least two people lost their lives while seven others were rescued when a boat capsized in Warri, Delta State. Survivors allegedly blamed the accident on the management of the Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Warri, for reportedly undermining safety measures. They also alleged that the NPA did not provide life jackets for the passengers to travel on the river.  It was learnt that two of the survivors had claimed that their boat capsized owing to the uncontrollable waves caused by one of the NPAâ€™s boats. It was learnt that two of the nine occupants of the boat got drowned because they were unable to swim.  One of the two people who drowned was identified as Loius Okpare from Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. His body was found at the riverside of the river. However, the second victim was yet to be identified or found.
