O fficials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) were dumbfounded after a coronavirus patient, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Murtala Ibrahim, vanished into thin air. Ibrahim is attached to 21 Mobile Police Force, Nyanya, Abuja.   The CSP’s disappearance occurred just as NCDC officials had been expressing worry over the escalating cases of COVID-19 carriers in the country. Witnesses said a mild drama played out when NCDC officials came to take Ibrahim to an isolation centre to continue his treatment. He locked out the NCDC officials and policemen, who came to pick him, and fled his apartment through the backdoor. The NCDC officials were said to have gone to Ibrahim’s apartment at Garki Police Barracks on Saturday about 2p.m.   A police source said Ibrahim had earlier been quarantined and had been on treatment at the National Hospital, Abuja. How he escaped from his treatment centre, remains a mystery.   The source said: “The NCDC officials were led by police personnel to the residence of the CSP. When the team got there, the CSP and members of his family were seen peeping at the policemen and NCDC officials through the window. All entreaties and admonitions for him to open his door to meet the evacuation team, proved abortive. The CSP was later sighted driving furiously out of the barracks in his car. In fact, his present destination is unknown.” Since Ibrahim’s disappearance, his phone lines have remained unreachable.   The police, who want to get him before he spreads the virus to his unsuspecting colleagues, have set up surveillance teams to trail and take him into custody. A medical team has also been alerted and is on standby for his arrest. The FCT Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mensah, said that he was not aware.   He, however, promised to find out about the matter and get back to our reporter. But as at press time, he was yet to do so.
