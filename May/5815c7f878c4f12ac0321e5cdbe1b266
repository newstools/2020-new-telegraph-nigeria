 Manchester United are close to agreeing a loan extension for striker Odion Ighalo.
United remain in talks with Ighalo’s parent club Shanghai Shenhua, and it is hoped a deal can be agreed before the striker’s current loan deal expires on Sunday, reports Sky Sports.
The proposed loan extension will run until the end of January, when Ighalo will return to Shanghai.
The Nigerian international is set to miss the majority of the 2020 Chinese Super League season, which is scheduled to begin in July.
Ighalo initially joined United in a surprise Deadline Day move in January, before scoring four times in eight appearances prior to the suspension of the Premier League.
Sky Sports News revealed in March that Ighalo had been offered a two-year contract extension Shanghai worth £400,000 a week.
Ighalo’s current contract expires in December 2022, but Shanghai want to keep him until at least December 2024.
