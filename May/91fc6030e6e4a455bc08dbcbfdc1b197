 The embattled state Department of Labour has now paid out a whopping $9.2 billion in unemployment insurance benefits to two million New Yorkers who have filed jobless claims since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, state officials confirmed Monday.
“That doesn’t mean every single person has been cleared from the backlog. It’s the majority of the people have been cleared from the backlog,” Cuomo top aide Melissa DeRosa told reporters during a Buffalo-based press briefing.
She added that incomplete or partially filled out applications, plus suspected fraud, are still keeping many residents from much needed funds, reports The New York Post.
“We’re getting very, very close. So, for the people that are outstanding that is now the exception, not the rule, and DOL is working round the clock to address those issues.”
Over the weekend the agency cleared a glut of 1.2 million applications filed between March 2 and April 22 in their latest attempt to fix the backlog, DOL Commissioner Roberta Reardon said during a separate press call.
She explained another 16,000 individuals are in the “final processing” stage, but are held up due fraud or because additional information is needed.
But 50,000 applications during that time period were marked ineligible for traditional unemployment insurance, but those people could qualify for pandemic unemployment insurance — the new COVD-19 federal program approved March 27.
Another 23,000 claimants haven’t been processed due to duplicate applications or missing information.
The claims crush got so bad the DOL hired several thousand extra workers to man the unemployment call center and updated its overwhelmed website by contracting with Google.
