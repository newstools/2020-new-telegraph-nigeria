O dion Ighalo still does not know where he will play football next, with his Manchester United loan deal due to expire on May 31, but he wants to remain at Old Trafford for the rest of his career, according to the Nigerian’s personal trainer.   United are happy to extend Ighalo’s loan deal in order to allow him to play the season to a conclusion, but parent club Shanghai Shenhua want the 30-year-old back for the Chinese Super League’s restart. Ighalo himself would like a permanent deal, but United are not pursuing a transfer.   Despite the uncertainty over his immediate future, Ighalo’s trainer says he has pushed himself to his limits to ensure he is in the best physical condition to make a return to the Premier League.   “He’s a wonderful athlete, I’ve never seen someone more passionate about their job than him,” Ekemini Ekerette told ‘Goal’. “I think he’s in excellent physical condition. He loves the game. He just wants to train. Even if the league wasn’t going to played in the next three months he would keep training every day. He is so disciplined.    “His future was not making a difference to his intensity in training. He is just always focused on making sure he’s doing what he needs to do and then pushing himself even further.   “He’s a team player and has been talking about [Marcus] Rashford, [Anthony] Martial, [Mason] Greenwood, and how fantastic they all are, so he’s looking forward to hopefully getting to play with Rashford. He wants to stay and loves United, Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] and the fans and he would love to be a Red for the rest of his life.”  Ighalo has impressed since arriving on the final day of the January transfer window, scoring four goals in three starts while his passion and desire have been praised by those around him.   When the United Kingdom went into lockdown in March, a number of the United first-team squad were given permission to fly home to isolate with their families, and Ighalo decided to travel back to his hometown of Lagos.
