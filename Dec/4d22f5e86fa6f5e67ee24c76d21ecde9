The agency, however, confirmed 122 new coronavirus infections in 10 states.
Kaduna was top of the list with 37 new positive samples, followed by Lagos with 29, and Plateau with 25.
However, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) now leads the current list of active cases with 722 patients, while Lagos comes next with 501 infections, and Oyo has the third highest figure with 340.
