The Flying Eagles of Nigeria has been eliminated from the ongoing West African Football Union qualifiers in Benin Republic.  The Nigeria side slim hope of qualification was dashed after Cote d’Ivoire defeated Ghana 1-0 in the final group game played on Saturday.  The Flying Eagles started the competition with a 1-1 draw against the Junior Elephants before succumbing to a 1-0 defeat against Ghana in their second game.  With three teams in the group, the Ladan Bosso-led side was hoping that Ghana will do them a favour by defeating Cote d’Ivoire, thereby allowing them to squeeze into the next stage of the Cham  ionships.
