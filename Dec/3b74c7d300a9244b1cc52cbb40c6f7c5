…says govt has met 98% of union’s demands Regina Otokpa, Abuja The Federal Government has hinted that university students were likely to return to classes in the next few weeks, saying the prolonged strike by the Academic  Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), may be called off in January.
Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who gave the hint on Monday at Alor in Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State at the flag-off of medical outreach in the town, said 98 percent of ASUU’s demands had already been met.
According to him, he was optimistic final decisions would be taken today (Tueaday), during the scheduled meeting between the Federal Government and leadership of the union.
He said: “We have met about 98 percent of the request of ASUU. The remaining two percent is what you can call promissory notes.
“So, I am very hopeful that by midnight Tuesday, there is work we are supposed to get on to do and ASUU members also have some work they are supposed to do on their own side with their people.
“We will meet in the afternoon and we will compare notes. We will put everything on the table and compare. I believe that we might have come to the end of the strike when we meet.
“Well, it is a journey of a thousand miles, which you will have to take one step first. All things being equal, we will agree now to agree because we were disagreeing before.
“We will disagree to agree and agree to disagree formerly. But I hope we will agree to agree. Once we do that, schools will open in January.”  FG: IPPIS officials to visit campuses for lecturers’ data capturing ASUU: We’re still consulting, to meet FG tomorrow SSANU: Today’s meeting with FG’ll determine our next line of action The unresolved faceoff between the Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other university staff unions over IPPIS… October 20, 2020 In "Education" FACE-OFF   Stakeholders are angry with the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) over the protracted strike that has paralysed academic activities and forestalled reopening of the universities, eight months after the declaration of the nationwide industrial action.
