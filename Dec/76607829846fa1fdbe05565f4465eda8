…as PoS deals hit N3.67trn Value of cheque transactions across the country plunged to N2.6 trillion in the last 10 months, New Telegraph has learnt. The figure represents a 29.7 per cent decline yearon- year compared with N3.7 trillion recorded in the same period last year as the downturn in the use of the paperbased channel continued. According to data released by Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS), the value was derived from a total of 3.9 million separate deals, which again was a decline from the volume recorded in the same period of last year, which stood at 6.6 million. On annual basis, the value of cheque transactions has been on a steady decline to hit an all-time low of N5 trillion in 2018, from an alltime high of N17.8 trillion recorded in 2009. The decline is attributed to the growing preference for electronic payment channels, which are considered faster than cheques. While cheque transactions valued at N4.4 trillion was recorded last year, a decline from N5.03 trillion recorded in 2018, the country is bound to record the lowest value in cheque deals this year. The downtrend for this year, analysts said, will be worsened by the one-month suspension of cheque transactions by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) during the COVID-19 lockdown.
